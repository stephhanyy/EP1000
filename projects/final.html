				<h2>final project</h2>
				<br>
				<p>the last graded assignment we have of the year is of us creating a project that involves everything we have learn in class the past semester. the project needs to be made with a microcontroller, input and output devices, laser cut housing and 3d printed components.</p>

				<h2>my project idea</h2>
				<p>
				initially i wanted to make a plant hydration detector that would sense whether my mom's community garden vegetables needed to be watered and send her a push notification on her phone to go down and water her plants. but i realised that the arduino would have to be wifi enabled to send notifications and the community garden didn't have wifi lol, so i scrapped the idea.
				</p>

				<p>
				my next idea was to recreate the classic operation game in arduino. the inspiration for this project is <a href="https://blog.arduino.cc/2017/07/24/make-your-own-operation-style-board-game-with-arduino/">this</a> and <a href="https://www.instructables.com/My-DIY-Steampunk-Operation-Game-Arduino-Based/">this</a>.
				</p>

				<p>this is a diagram of how my project would work:</p>
